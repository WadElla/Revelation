 Apache2 has a default setting that does not allow direct access to any file apart from those located in /var/www, public_html directories (when enabled), or /usr/share for web applications. This could potentially expose vulnerabilities if the default configurations are not properly secured.

Given this context, it's possible that an attacker might use port scanning as a precursor to identifying potential vulnerabilities in an Apache2 setup. However, without explicit information on 'Port Scanning' attacks, it's challenging to provide a definitive answer regarding its associated risks.

However, based on the provided information, we can infer that the Flow ID TCP_0 is a DDoS_TCP attack.

According to the [DDoS_TCP] section, this attack type often affects routers, embedded Linux devices, or gateway firewalls, causing memory exhaustion. The recommended mitigation strategies for DDoS_TCP include enabling SYN cookies, tuning OS TCP parameters, and monitoring for high-rate IPs with excessive half-open connections.

As the Flow ID is specific to TCP_0, we can assume that it's related to a particular TCP connection. However, without more information about the source and destination IP addresses or MAC addresses, we cannot provide their exact values.

It's possible that these addresses are not explicitly mentioned in the retrieved chunk due to the nature of network traffic analysis, which often focuses on packet patterns and protocols rather than specific IP and MAC addresses.",0.8058913350105286,0.8292175531387329,0.8173880577087402,0.16304347826086957,0.01098901098901099,0.11956521739130435,0.002290553630046086,0.16997167138810196
