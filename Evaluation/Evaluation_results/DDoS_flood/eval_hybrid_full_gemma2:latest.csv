2. **Sum the TTLs:** Add up all the TTL values you found in step 1.

3. **Count the Connections:** Determine how many TCP connections are listed in the summary (each connection has a unique ""tcp.stream"" number).

4. **Calculate the Average:** Divide the sum of the TTL values from step 2 by the number of connections from step 3.


**Important Notes:**

*  The provided data snippets only show two frames. To get an accurate average, you'd need to analyze a larger sample of TCP connections.
