* **UDP:** Mentioned as the primary protocol for DDoS_UDP attacks, these floods often target services like NTP, DNS, or SSDP.
* **MQTT:** Used in both ""MITM"" and ""Backdoor"" activities, suggesting potential command-and-control channels or data exfiltration. 
* **DNS:**  Targeted by DDoS_UDP attacks and used for querying domain names (e.g., 0.debian.pool.ntp.org, 1.debian.pool.ntp.org, 2.debian.pool.ntp.org)
* **Modbus:** Mentioned in both ""MITM"" and ""Backdoor"" activities, suggesting potential control over industrial devices.

**To get a precise breakdown of flows by protocol, you would need more detailed network traffic analysis data.** Tools like Wireshark or tcpdump can capture and analyze network packets to provide this information.
