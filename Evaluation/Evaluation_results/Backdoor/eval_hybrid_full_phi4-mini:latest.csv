The TCP flags pattern for these flows is ""SYN → RST, ACK"", which indicates that an initial connection attempt was made using the SYN flag followed by a reset of this attempted connection and finally acknowledging it with an ACK packet from `192.168.0.170`.

Given this information alone does not directly reveal whether or not there has been successful establishment because we are missing some details (e.g., receiving RST packets back), but given that multiple attempts were made to establish a TCP session using the SYN flag, and assuming these traffic samples represent all relevant flows without any missed ACKs for received SNRTs from `192.168.0.170`, it suggests there was an attempt at establishing connections.

However, we can't definitively say what state those attempted sessions are in (e.g., established) because we'd need to see the RST packets sent back by host 192.168.0.128 and any corresponding ACKs received on port 4321 from `192.168.0.170`. Without this information or without seeing a successful three-way handshake complete with SYN, SYN-ACK (acknowledged), followed by an ACK to close the connection (""FIN""), we can't state that connections were successfully established.

- Destination (TCP): 192.168.0.170 on Port 4321

The entry includes the following details:
- The sequence number is ""4282643911"" for incoming packets and presumably an outgoing packet with a next sequence (""nxtseq"") of ""1"".
- A TCP SYN flag indicates that this was likely part of establishing or resuming a connection.
- There are no ACK (acknowledgment) flags present, suggesting either the initial segment received by 192.168.0.128 had not yet been acknowledged back to its source nor is there an ongoing acknowledgment exchange taking place at this moment in time.

The data does indicate that TCP port 4321 was used for communication between these two IP addresses; however, without a sequence of events or timestamps indicating the exact timing and duration (history) of connection attempts beyond what one packet shows here with SYN flag set to ""1"", we cannot construct an accurate history. To provide such historical data would require additional context from logs that record each step in establishing connections over time.

In summary:
- A TCP connection attempt was observed using port 4321 on IP address 192.168.0.128 toward the destination IP of 192.168.0.170.

- The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) uses protocol number **1**.
- Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) and Reverse ARP use protocols numbered between **3 - 254**, but it is not commonly used for ICMP connections.

So, the IP protocol number specifically assigned as per RFC 1812 to identify an ICMP connection would be:

**Protocol Number: 1**

However, it's important to note that in practice (especially with modern systems), other numbers are often associated more frequently. But strictly following the standard's assignment for identification purposes is Protocol **1**.

For additional context:
- TCP connections typically use protocol number **6**, and UDP uses **17**.
- ICMP messages themselves don't have a ""protocol"" as such within an IP packet; they exist in separate packets that carry their own type (0) and code. But when referencing the underlying transport layer protocols for which they're used, it would be:
  - For TCP: Protocol number is generally considered **6**.

The origin for the ICMP traffic with a destination of ff02 (likely referring to an IPv6 address format like ::ff02/ffff:db8::) is not directly provided in any unique endpoint or protocol-level metadata from the retrieved chunks, but if we were looking at DDoS_HTTP as it includes 0 → 224.0.0.1 which could be associated with ff01 (the link-local address prefix), then this would indicate that there was traffic originating internally within a subnet of IP addresses starting with '00'. The response to such an ICMP destination, however, is not specified in the retrieved chunks and therefore cannot be determined from the given data.

It’s important to note that DDoS_HTTP may involve many different types of responses due to its nature as a Distributed Denial-of-Service attack type which typically generates numerous packets including various protocols like HTTP (port 80), HTTPS (port 443) among others, not just ICMP. The actual IP addresses involved in the response would need more specific data on what traffic was observed for an accurate determination.

Given this limitation and without additional context or information regarding other activities that might have occurred concurrently which could be linked to ff02/ffff:db8:: (a link-local IPv6 address), we can only speculate based upon common DDoS patterns. In a real-world scenario, further investigation would involve capturing the actual traffic using network monitoring tools and analyzing it for specific source IP addresses corresponding with known activities or signatures that match an attack pattern which includes ff02/ffff:db8:: as either origin (source) or destination within ICMP packets.
