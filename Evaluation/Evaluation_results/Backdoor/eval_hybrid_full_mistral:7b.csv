3. UDP (User Datagram Protocol): There are no explicit UDP flows mentioned in the provided analysis, but it does discuss DDoS_UDP activity which typically involves high-speed UDP floods.

4. MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) protocol: One MQTT topic is observed across two categories of traffic (MITM and Backdoor), with the topic number being 0.

5. DNS (Domain Name System) protocol: Three DNS queries are observed, targeting '0', '0.debian.pool.ntp.org', and '1.debian.pool.ntp.org' for the MITM category, and '0' and '2.debian.pool.ntp.org' for the Backdoor category.

6. Modbus protocol: One Modbus Unit ID (0) is observed across both MITM and Backdoor categories of traffic.",0.7696446180343628,0.8406174778938293,0.8035669326782227,0.04669260700389105,0.00784313725490196,0.038910505836575876,0.001167007288076189,0.06711409395973156
