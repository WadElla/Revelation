There are two relevant frames with a 'TCP' protocol and a specific sequence number (tcp.seq: ""1550667417"" and tcp.nxtseq: ""150""). Assuming that these sequences represent a connection, we can estimate the total number of bytes exchanged for this Flow ID TCP_0 by analyzing the TCP analysis data.

The initial rtt is 0.003499000 seconds, and the push_bytes_sent is 149 bytes. The window size value is 509, which may indicate the maximum amount of data that can be sent in a single transmission. However, without more information about the flow's duration or other relevant details, it's difficult to calculate the exact total number of bytes exchanged.

If we assume an average transmission time (rtt) of 0.012292000 seconds and use this window size, we could estimate the total number of bytes sent over this connection as follows:

Total Bytes = (Window Size x Time per Transmission) / (1 - (Initial Rtt / Window Size))
