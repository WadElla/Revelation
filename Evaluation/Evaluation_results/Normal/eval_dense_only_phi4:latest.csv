"""How many total traffic samples were analyzed, and what percentage of the traffic was classified as anomalous?""","""A total of 170,435 traffic samples were analyzed. Anomalous traffic accounted for 4,776 samples, which is 2.80% of the total traffic."",","To determine how many total traffic samples were analyzed and what percentage of them were classified as anomalous, let's first analyze the provided data:

1. **Total Traffic Samples**: Each JSON object represents a traffic sample. In this case, there are four distinct samples provided.

2. **Anomalous Classification**:
   - A traffic sample is typically considered anomalous if it contains certain expert analysis messages or flags indicating unusual behavior.
   - In the provided data, each sample includes an `_ws.expert` section with a message ""Connection finish (FIN)"" and another message ""This frame initiates the connection closing"". These are standard TCP FIN flag operations used to close a connection, not necessarily anomalous by themselves.

Given that all samples contain similar expert messages related to normal TCP connection termination, none of them are explicitly flagged as anomalous based on the provided data. 

3. **Percentage Calculation**:
   - Total Samples: 4
   - Anomalous Samples: 0

The percentage of traffic classified as anomalous is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Percentage of Anomalous Traffic} = \left(\frac{\text{Number of Anomalous Samples}}{\text{Total Number of Samples}}\right) \times 100 = \left(\frac{0}{4}\right) \times 100 = 0\%
\]

**Conclusion**: There are 4 total traffic samples analyzed, and 0% of the traffic is classified as anomalous based on the provided data.",0.7745897769927979,0.8444661498069763,0.8080200552940369,0.1471861471861472,0.052401746724890834,0.11255411255411256,0.006688983426026025,0.1751981784449317
"""What is the most prevalent anomalous traffic type, and what is its severity level?""","""SQL Injection is the dominant detected attack, with 1,788 samples, making up 1.05% of the traffic. Its severity is classified as High."",","The provided data contains multiple entries of network traffic frames with specific details about Ethernet (eth), Internet Protocol (ip), Transmission Control Protocol (tcp), and MQTT protocol characteristics. Each entry includes metadata such as timestamps, source and destination information, and various flags or status indicators.

In the context of analyzing this data for anomalous traffic types and their severity levels, we need to focus on specific fields that indicate anomalies:

1. **TCP Flags**: The `tcp.flags` field is particularly important here because it indicates connection control states such as SYN, ACK, FIN, etc.
2. **Expert Analysis Messages**: These are found under `_ws.expert.message`, which provide insights into whether the traffic represents an anomaly and its nature.

In all provided entries, the following pattern emerges:

- The `tcp.flags` includes a value of `0x0019`. This corresponds to the flags `ACK (1) | PSH (16) | FIN (2)`.
- Each entry has expert analysis messages indicating:
  - `""Connection finish (FIN)""`: This message suggests that a TCP connection is being closed.
  - `""This frame initiates the connection closing""`: This indicates an active closure of the connection.

The severity levels provided in these entries are:

- `tcp.connection.fin` with a severity level of `2097152`.
- `tcp.connection.fin_active` with a higher severity level of `4194304`.

### Conclusion

The most prevalent anomalous traffic type identified here is related to TCP connections being actively closed, as indicated by the presence of the FIN flag and expert analysis messages. The anomaly's highest severity level is associated with the message `""This frame initiates the connection closing""`, which has a severity level of `4194304`. This suggests that active closure events are considered more severe anomalies compared to mere FIN flags being set.",0.7676087021827698,0.8301718235015869,0.7976654767990112,0.079734219269103,0.013377926421404682,0.05980066445182724,0.001937464484827765,0.10548523206751056

"""What is the behavioral signature of a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack?""","""Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks attempt to intercept or alter communications between devices, often through ARP spoofing or rogue gateways."",","A Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack involves an attacker secretly intercepting and possibly altering the communication between two parties who believe they are directly communicating with each other. Identifying such attacks in network traffic can be challenging, but there are several behavioral signatures or indicators that might suggest a MITM is occurring:

1. **Unexpected IP Addresses**: 
   - If you notice unexpected intermediate IPs appearing in the communication path between the expected source and destination, this could indicate an attacker intercepting the traffic.

2. **Session Hijacking**:
   - Observations of session IDs changing unexpectedly or being reused in a suspicious manner can be indicative of a MITM attack where the attacker attempts to take over an existing session.

3. **Unusual SSL/TLS Certificates**:
   - Presence of self-signed certificates, expired certificates, or certificates not matching the expected domain could suggest that an attacker is attempting to impersonate a legitimate server.

4. **Packet Reordering and Duplication**:
   - Anomalies such as unexpected reordering or duplication of packets can occur if an attacker is intercepting and modifying traffic.

5. **Latency Changes**:
   - Unexplained increases in latency might indicate that the traffic is being routed through an intermediary point controlled by an attacker.

6. **Unusual Traffic Patterns**:
   - Sudden spikes in network traffic, especially on ports typically not used for large data transfers, may suggest data exfiltration or interception activities.

7. **DNS Spoofing Indicators**:
   - If DNS responses are being manipulated to redirect traffic to malicious servers, you might observe unusual DNS query patterns or responses that don't match the expected domain name resolutions.

8. **Multiple Connections with Similar Characteristics**:
   - Multiple simultaneous connections between a client and different IPs all claiming to be legitimate endpoints can be indicative of MITM attempts using various IP addresses for redundancy or load balancing by an attacker.

9. **Inconsistent Application Layer Data**:
   - Inconsistencies in the application layer data, such as mismatched content lengths or unexpected alterations in message formats, might indicate tampering.

10. **TCP/UDP Session Anomalies**:
    - Abrupt termination of sessions or unusual patterns in TCP handshake processes (e.g., SYN floods) can be signs of MITM activities aimed at disrupting legitimate communication channels.

It's important to note that these indicators alone do not confirm a MITM attack; they are potential signs that should prompt further investigation.

The behavior is characterized by hidden channels or implants that enable an attacker to regain access even after reboots or remediation."",","In network security, a ""Backdoor"" attack refers to unauthorized access points left in software or systems that allow attackers to bypass normal authentication processes. These backdoors can be intentional (for legitimate maintenance) or unintentional (due to poor coding practices). When analyzing packet captures for signs of such an attack, certain indicators might suggest the presence of a backdoor:

### Severity
- **High**: Backdoor attacks are considered severe because they allow attackers persistent access and control over systems. This can lead to data breaches, system manipulation, or further exploitation within a network.

### Behavioral Signature
1. **Unusual Traffic Patterns**:
   - Unexpected connections from unusual IP addresses.
   - Connections on non-standard ports that aren't typically used by the application.

2. **Unauthorized Access Attempts**:
   - Repeated failed login attempts followed by successful access without apparent user intervention.
   
3. **Data Exfiltration**:
   - Large volumes of data being sent to external IPs, especially during off-peak hours or from unexpected internal sources.

4. **System Anomalies**:
   - Changes in system files or configurations that are not documented.
   - Presence of unfamiliar processes running on the system.

5. **Communication with Known Malicious Domains/IPs**:
   - Traffic to or from IP addresses or domains associated with known malicious activities.

6. **Persistence Mechanisms**:

### Recommended Mitigation Strategies

1. **Traffic Filtering**:
   - Use firewalls and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to filter out malicious traffic.
   - Implement rate limiting on your servers to manage the number of requests from a single IP address.

2. **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)**:
   - Employ CDNs to distribute traffic across multiple servers, reducing the load on any single server.
   - CDNs can also cache content closer to users, improving performance and providing additional layers of defense against attacks.

3. **Anomaly Detection**:
   - Implement systems that monitor network traffic for unusual patterns indicative of a DDoS attack.
   - Use machine learning models to predict and identify potential threats based on historical data.

4. **Scrubbing Centers**:
   - Utilize third-party scrubbing centers that can filter out malicious traffic before it reaches your servers.
   - These centers specialize in identifying and blocking DDoS traffic, allowing legitimate requests through.

5. **Redundancy and Scalability**:
   - Design systems with redundancy to ensure availability even if one or more components are compromised.
   - Use scalable cloud resources that can be dynamically adjusted based on demand.

6. **Emergency Response Plan**:
   - Develop a comprehensive incident response plan specifically for DDoS attacks, detailing roles, responsibilities, and actions.
   - Conduct regular drills to ensure your team is prepared to respond effectively in the event of an attack.

7. **Network Configuration**:
   - Configure routers and switches to drop malformed packets and implement Access Control Lists (ACLs) to block suspicious traffic.
   - Enable SYN cookies to protect against SYN flood attacks, which are a common type of DDoS assault on HTTP services.

8. **Collaboration with ISPs**:
   - Work closely with your Internet Service Provider (ISP) to quickly identify and mitigate large-scale DDoS attacks.
   - ISPs can reroute traffic or block malicious sources at the network level.

The flow summaries can be derived from analyzing common attributes across these packets.

### Application Summary for Flow ID: TCP_0

1. **Protocol**: 
   - The traffic is using the TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) over IP.
   - The application layer protocol identified is MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport), a lightweight messaging protocol often used in IoT applications.

2. **Source and Destination**:
   - **Source IP**: 192.168.3.18
   - **Destination IP**: 192.168.3.12
   - The source and destination MAC addresses are consistent, indicating communication between the same devices or endpoints within a local network.

3. **Ports**:
   - **Source Ports**: Vary across connections (e.g., 55352, 57778, 55243).
   - **Destination Port**: Consistently 1883, which is the default port for MQTT broker communications.

4. **Connection Details**:
   - The TCP flags indicate that these packets are part of connection teardown sequences, as they include the FIN flag (indicating the end of data transmission) and the PUSH flag.
   - Multiple streams or connections are identified by different stream IDs (e.g., 5179, 7390).

5. **Timing**:
   - The relative timestamps (`tcp.time_relative`) suggest these packets were captured at different times but within a short interval, indicating multiple MQTT sessions being established and closed.

6. **Flow Characteristics**:
   - Each flow involves establishing a connection, possibly exchanging MQTT messages, and then closing the connection.
   - The consistent use of the FIN flag in TCP flags across flows suggests that these connections are short-lived, typical for MQTT where clients connect to publish or subscribe to topics and then disconnect.

7. **Network Behavior**:
   - The data shows multiple instances of similar patterns, suggesting a client repeatedly connecting to an MQTT broker, performing its operations (like publishing/subscribing), and then disconnecting.
   - This behavior is common in IoT environments where devices periodically send data or updates to a central server.

In summary, Flow ID TCP_0 represents multiple instances of MQTT communications over TCP, with the source device frequently establishing short-lived connections to an MQTT broker on port 1883 for sending/receiving messages. The consistent use of FIN flags indicates these are connection teardowns after brief interactions typical in IoT applications.",0.7518415451049805,0.8583508133888245,0.8015735745429993,0.06417112299465241,0.043010752688172046,0.058823529411764705,0.003357900132817013,0.13488247863247865

1. **Protocols and Ports**: 
   - All the frames listed are using TCP (protocol number 6) on port 1883, which is commonly used by MQTT over TCP.
   - There is no mention of UDP (protocol number 17), indicating that there might not be any UDP traffic captured in this dataset.

Each frame contains information about a specific packet within a TCP session, including timestamps and sequence numbers.

### Steps:

1. **Identify Frames Belonging to the Connection:**
   - Look for consistent patterns in source/destination IP addresses and ports that match across frames.
   - The UID 'CczSu14KDCWOJpCK4' is not explicitly mentioned in the provided data, so we assume it corresponds to one of these sessions.

2. **Extract Relevant Information:**
   - From each frame, note the `tcp.time_relative` (relative time) and `frame.number`.

3. **Calculate Duration:**
   - Identify the earliest and latest timestamps (`tcp.time_relative`) from the frames.
   - Subtract the earliest timestamp from the latest to get the total duration.

4. **Count Total Packets:**
   - Count the number of unique frame numbers within the identified session.

### Analysis:

#### Frames Identified:
- Frame 1: `tcp.time_relative = 0.016519000`, `frame.number = 102305`
- Frame 2: `tcp.time_relative = 0.018367000`, `frame.number = 128306`

Assuming these frames belong to the same TCP session:

#### Duration Calculation:
- Earliest timestamp: `0.016519000`
- Latest timestamp: `0.018367000`
- Duration = `0.018367000 - 0.016519000 = 0.001848000` seconds

Given the `mqtt.hdrflags` value ""0xe0"" in hexadecimal:
- Convert ""0xe0"" to binary: `11100000`

The frames provided are part of a TCP connection, specifically involving MQTT messages.

### Analyzing Each Frame:

1. **Frame 1:**
   - Sequence Number (seq): `39`
   - Next Sequence Number (nxtseq): `42`
   - Length of Data: `2` bytes
   - This frame is the start of a TCP connection with an initial data segment of `2` bytes.

2. **Frame 2:**
   - Sequence Number (seq): `41`
   - Next Sequence Number (nxtseq): `44`
   - Length of Data: `2` bytes
   - This frame continues from the previous sequence number, adding another `2` bytes.

3. **Frame 3:**
   - Sequence Number (seq): `43`
   - Next Sequence Number (nxtseq): `46`
   - Length of Data: `2` bytes
   - Another continuation frame with `2` more bytes.

4. **Frame 4:**
   - Sequence Number (seq): `45`
   - Next Sequence Number (nxtseq): `48`
   - Length of Data: `2` bytes
   - Final data segment in the sequence, adding `2` bytes.

5. **Response Frame:**
   - Sequence Number (seq): `5`
   - Next Sequence Number (nxtseq): `8`
   - Length of Data: `3` bytes
   - This frame is a response to the initial frames, starting with an acknowledgment and containing `3` bytes of data.

### Total Calculation:

- **Original Bytes Sent:**
  - Frame 1: `2` bytes
  - Frame 2: `2` bytes
  - Frame 3: `2` bytes
  - Frame 4: `2` bytes
  - **Total Original Bytes = 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8 bytes**

- **Response Bytes Received:**
  - Response Frame: `3` bytes
  - **Total Response Bytes = 3 bytes**

### Conclusion:

The total number of original bytes sent is `8`, and the total number of response bytes received is `3`. Therefore, for the TCP connection with UID 'Cfjywu4xTjwioQyod4', the combined total of original and response bytes is:

The data consists of network traffic details focusing on Ethernet (eth), IP, TCP, and MQTT layers for specific frames within a network capture. 

To determine the DNS query type for '1.debian.pool.ntp.org', you would typically need to analyze DNS packet information from a network capture file (such as a Wireshark dump) that includes DNS request details.

Here are general steps on how you might find this information if it were available:

1. **Identify DNS Packets**: Look through the network traffic data for packets using UDP or TCP protocol on port 53, which is standard for DNS queries and responses.

2. **Examine DNS Query Details**:
   - Check for a packet with a DNS query section.
   - Within this section, identify the queried domain name (in your case '1.debian.pool.ntp.org').

3. **Determine Query Type**:
   - The DNS query type is indicated by a two-byte field following the domain name in the query message.
   - Common types include A (Address Record), AAAA (IPv6 Address Record), MX (Mail Exchange Record), etc.

4. **Reference DNS Protocol Documentation**: Use resources like RFC 1035 to understand what each query type signifies if you need more context about a specific type number.

However, the given JSON-like snippets do not contain any explicit mention of a UID or its associated details such as the MQTT topic name and payload length.

The information you've shared includes various fields related to network frames (Ethernet, IP, TCP) and MQTT headers but does not directly reference UIDs or specific message contents beyond headers. If `CwCN0KeqJKzKrrvwd` is a unique identifier for an MQTT message, it would typically be found within the payload of the MQTT packet itself.

To find this information:

1. **Extract Payload Data**: You need to examine the payload section of each TCP frame that carries MQTT data. This involves parsing the raw binary data after the Ethernet, IP, and TCP headers.
   
2. **Decode MQTT Messages**: Once you have access to the payload data, decode it according to the MQTT protocol specifications. Look for fixed header information which includes the message type (e.g., publish) and variable header that contains the topic name.

3. **Identify UID in Payload**: Search within the decoded payload for `CwCN0KeqJKzKrrvwd` as part of a JSON or other structured format, depending on how messages are constructed.

4. **Extract Topic Name and Payload Length**: Once you locate the message with this UID, extract the topic name from the variable header section of the MQTT publish packet and determine the payload length accordingly.

"""What is the connection state history for the TCP flow with UID 'CAky7oXUlFHkjO2Lj'?""","""The connection history is 'ShADadFfr'."",","To determine the connection state history for the TCP flow with UID `'CAky7oXUlFHkjO2Lj'`, we need to analyze the given packet data and extract information about the TCP flags. The primary focus is on SYN, ACK, and FIN flags which indicate different states in a TCP connection lifecycle.

Here's a breakdown of the connection state history based on the provided packet captures:

1. **Initial Connection Establishment:**
   - A typical TCP connection begins with a three-way handshake:
     1. **SYN Sent:** The client sends a SYN (synchronize) packet to initiate a connection.
     2. **SYN-ACK Received:** The server responds with a SYN-ACK (synchronize-acknowledge) packet.
     3. **ACK Sent:** The client acknowledges the server's SYN-ACK with an ACK (acknowledge) packet.

   However, this initial handshake is not explicitly detailed in the provided data. We will assume it has occurred since there are packets marked with FIN flags.

2. **Data Transfer:**
   - After the connection establishment, data transfer occurs between the client and server. The data packets typically have only the ACK flag set to acknowledge received segments.
   - In this case, we don't see explicit data packets (with payload), but we do observe TCP segments with ACK and PUSH flags, indicating acknowledgment of received data and pushing data onto the connection.

3. **Connection Termination:**
   - The termination of a TCP connection involves:
     1. **FIN Sent:** One side sends a FIN (finish) packet to signal it has finished sending data.
     2. **ACK Received:** The other side acknowledges the FIN with an ACK.
     3. **FIN Sent:** The other side then sends its own FIN packet after completing its data transmission.
     4. **ACK Received:** The initial sender acknowledges this second FIN.

   From the provided packets:
   - Each packet shows a TCP segment with both ACK and PUSH flags set, followed by a FIN flag in the same or subsequent packet. This indicates that after some data transfer (indicated by the presence of PUSH), each side is signaling its intent to close the connection with a FIN packet.
   - The repeated pattern of `ACK, PUSH` followed by `FIN` suggests multiple connections being established and terminated within this flow.

4. **Repeated Connection Cycles:**
   - Each set of packets with an ending FIN flag likely represents a complete cycle of connection establishment (implied), data transfer, and termination.
   - The timestamps (`tcp.time_relative`) suggest these cycles occur at different intervals, indicating multiple connections being opened and closed over time.

In summary, the TCP flow `'CAky7oXUlFHkjO2Lj'` exhibits a pattern of repeated connection cycles where each cycle involves:
- Implied establishment (SYN/SYN-ACK/ACK not shown),
- Data transfer (indicated by PUSH),
- Termination with FIN flags.

"""What is the behavioral signature of a 'Credential Stuffing' attack?""","""A 'Credential Stuffing' attack uses pre-existing credentials to gain unauthorized access to an IoT system."",","A ""Credential Stuffing"" attack involves an attacker using automated tools to attempt logging in with username and password pairs across various websites, typically leveraging stolen credentials from previous data breaches. The behavioral signature of such an attack can be identified by analyzing network traffic patterns and user behavior. Here are some key indicators:

1. **High Volume of Login Attempts**: A sudden spike in login attempts over a short period is often observed. This might involve numerous automated requests trying different username-password combinations on the same or multiple accounts.

2. **Repeated Failures**: Many failed login attempts followed by successful ones, as attackers try many passwords before finding the correct one for an account, are common signs of credential stuffing.

3. **Uniform User-Agent Strings**: The use of identical or similar user-agent strings across numerous requests can indicate bot activity rather than human behavior.

4. **Short Time Intervals Between Requests**: Automated tools typically make login attempts in rapid succession compared to typical human users who would take more time between attempts.

5. **IP Address Patterns**: Multiple failed login attempts originating from the same IP address or a range of IP addresses within a short timeframe can suggest automated attacks, especially if those IPs are known proxies or VPNs.

6. **Login Attempts on Different Accounts**: Repeated login attempts across different accounts rather than focusing on a single account may indicate credential stuffing, as attackers use lists of credentials to try multiple combinations.

7. **Geographical Inconsistencies**: Login attempts from geographically disparate locations in an unusually short time frame can be indicative of bot activity, especially if the user's typical access patterns are inconsistent with such behavior.

8. **Behavioral Anomalies**: Deviations from a user’s usual login pattern, such as logging in at unusual times or from unfamiliar devices and locations, may suggest compromised credentials being used by an attacker.

Here are some common risks and types of password attacks:

1. **Brute Force Attacks**: Attackers systematically try every possible combination of characters until the correct password is found. This method can be time-consuming but may succeed if passwords are weak (e.g., short or using common patterns).

2. **Dictionary Attacks**: Similar to brute force, but attackers use a precompiled list of commonly used passwords and variations thereof. These attacks exploit users who choose simple, predictable passwords.

3. **Phishing Attacks**: Attackers deceive individuals into revealing their passwords by masquerading as a trustworthy entity in electronic communications. This can lead to unauthorized access if the user enters their credentials on a fake website.

4. **Keylogging**: Malicious software records keystrokes made by users, capturing passwords and other sensitive information entered via the keyboard.

5. **Credential Stuffing**: Attackers use lists of compromised usernames and passwords from previous breaches to attempt logins across multiple sites, exploiting users who reuse passwords.

6. **Social Engineering**: Psychological manipulation is used to trick individuals into divulging confidential information, including passwords.

7. **Password Spraying**: This involves attempting a small number of commonly used passwords against many accounts before triggering lockout mechanisms.

8. **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks**: Attackers intercept communication between the user and the service to capture passwords during transmission, often exploiting unsecured networks.

9. **Rainbow Table Attacks**: Precomputed tables for reversing cryptographic hash functions are used to crack password hashes stored in databases.

10. **Session Hijacking**: Once logged in, attackers hijack a user's session by stealing their session token or cookie, allowing unauthorized access without needing the password.

### Mitigations

- Use strong, unique passwords for different accounts.
- Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) to add an extra layer of security.
- Implement account lockout mechanisms after several failed login attempts.

   - **Banner Grabbing:** Attempts to connect to services and retrieve information about the software running on them.

2. **Severity:**
   - The severity of a vulnerability scanner attack can vary based on several factors:
     - **Intent and Context:** If the scanning is part of reconnaissance for a subsequent attack, it may be considered more severe.
     - **Network Sensitivity:** Scanning in sensitive or high-security environments (e.g., financial institutions) might be deemed more critical.
     - **Compliance Requirements:** Violations of regulatory requirements regarding network security and data protection can increase severity.

In terms of the logs you provided, none explicitly indicate a ""Vul Scanner"" attack. However, if such patterns were observed in similar logs, they would align with the behavioral signatures described above. The severity would be assessed based on organizational policies, potential impact, and the context within which the scanning occurs.",0.7803460359573364,0.8772762417793274,0.825977087020874,0.11072664359861592,0.04181184668989547,0.08304498269896193,0.0025780222359010584,0.159707190957191
"""What is the `conn_state` and history for the MQTT connection with UID `Cfjywu4xTjwioQyod4`?""","""The connection state is 'SF' and the history is 'ShDadAFfr'."",","To determine the `conn_state` and history of the MQTT connection with UID `Cfjywu4xTjwioQyod4`, we need to analyze the provided frames for patterns that indicate connection states, such as connection initiation (SYN), data transfer (ACK/PUSH), and termination (FIN).

### Analysis:

1. **Connection Initiation:**
   - Look for TCP flags `SYN` set in the frames. This indicates the start of a new connection.
   - Check if there are corresponding `SYN-ACK` responses from the server.

2. **Data Transfer:**
   - Frames with `ACK` and `PUSH` flags indicate ongoing data transfer.
   - The presence of MQTT headers (e.g., `mqtt.hdrflags`) suggests active communication.

3. **Connection Termination:**
   - Look for TCP flags `FIN` set in the frames, indicating a request to close the connection.
   - Check for corresponding `ACK` responses to confirm closure.

### Frame Analysis:

- **Frame 1:**
  - Timestamp: `1640656980.018867000`
  - Flags: `SYN`, `ACK`, `PUSH`
  - Indicates connection initiation and data transfer.

- **Frames 2 & 3:**
  - Similar to Frame 1, indicating ongoing communication.
  - Flags: `SYN`, `ACK`, `PUSH`

- **Frame 4:**
  - Timestamp: `1640656980.018969000`
  - Flags: `FIN`, `ACK`, `PUSH`
  - Indicates initiation of connection termination.

- **Frames 5, 6 & 7:**
  - Similar to Frame 4, indicating ongoing termination process.
  - Flags: `FIN`, `ACK`, `PUSH`

### Conclusion:

- **Connection State:**
  - The connection was initiated and data was transferred successfully (indicated by `SYN`, `ACK`, `PUSH`).
  - The connection was terminated (`FIN`) after the data transfer.

- **History:**
  - The connection lifecycle includes initiation, active communication, and termination.
  - The sequence of frames shows a typical MQTT session with proper closure.

This analysis suggests that the MQTT connection UID `Cfjywu4xTjwioQyod4` followed a standard lifecycle from initiation to termination.",0.7400652170181274,0.8230410218238831,0.779350757598877,0.04633204633204634,0.01556420233463035,0.04633204633204634,0.0009262939900915152,0.05509641873278237
