=== Category-wise Breakdown and Analysis ===

[Normal]
- Count: 6 (0.15%)
- No action needed. Traffic appears regular.

[MITM]
This section provides a summary of how MITM activity manifested in the analyzed traffic. A total of 2 samples (0.05% of traffic) were classified under this attack type. The summary includes its behavioral signature, severity level, potential impact on IoT infrastructure, and recommended mitigation strategies.
- Count: 2 (0.05%)
- Category: Interception / Impersonation
- Severity: High
- Behavior: Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks attempt to intercept or alter communications between devices, often through ARP spoofing or rogue gateways.
- Risk: Sensitive data, including credentials or configuration commands, can be silently stolen or manipulated.
- Recommendation: Isolate the affected subnet, inspect ARP tables and DHCP leases, and enforce certificate validation for encrypted traffic.

[Ransomware]
This section provides a summary of how Ransomware activity manifested in the analyzed traffic. A total of 183 samples (4.58% of traffic) were classified under this attack type. The summary includes its behavioral signature, severity level, potential impact on IoT infrastructure, and recommended mitigation strategies.
- Count: 183 (4.58%)
- Category: Malware Deployment
- Severity: Critical
- Behavior: Malicious code designed to encrypt device data or lock access until a ransom is paid, possibly spreading laterally across the network.
- Risk: Can disrupt industrial systems or critical home infrastructure, causing major data loss or service outages.
- Recommendation: Immediately isolate affected hosts, restore from clean backups, and assess lateral movement. Report incidents if needed.

[SQL Injection]
This section provides a summary of how SQL Injection activity manifested in the analyzed traffic. A total of 99 samples (2.48% of traffic) were classified under this attack type. The summary includes its behavioral signature, severity level, potential impact on IoT infrastructure, and recommended mitigation strategies.
- Count: 99 (2.48%)
- Category: Injection Exploits
- Severity: High
- Behavior: Malicious SQL statements are injected into application inputs to exfiltrate data or manipulate backend databases.
- Risk: Can compromise user records, leak credentials, or allow remote access to control systems.
- Recommendation: Sanitize all input fields, apply least privilege DB access, and use parameterized queries or ORMs.

[DDoS_HTTP]
This section provides a summary of how DDoS_HTTP activity manifested in the analyzed traffic. A total of 11 samples (0.28% of traffic) were classified under this attack type. The summary includes its behavioral signature, severity level, potential impact on IoT infrastructure, and recommended mitigation strategies.
- Count: 11 (0.28%)
- Category: Volumetric Denial-of-Service
- Severity: High
- Behavior: Large volumes of HTTP requests target web servers or REST APIs to exhaust resources.
- Risk: May lead to downtime of dashboards, control panels, or external APIs used by IoT systems.
- Recommendation: Deploy rate limiting, reverse proxies, or cloud-based DDoS protection. Identify attacker IPs for blacklisting.

[Password]
This section provides a summary of how Password activity manifested in the analyzed traffic. A total of 1 samples (0.03% of traffic) were classified under this attack type. The summary includes its behavioral signature, severity level, potential impact on IoT infrastructure, and recommended mitigation strategies.
- Count: 1 (0.03%)
- Category: Credential Brute Force
- Severity: Medium
- Behavior: Numerous login attempts with different passwords, targeting SSH, Telnet, HTTP, or MQTT services.
- Risk: Can lead to device hijacking or access to administrative interfaces if default or weak passwords are used.
- Recommendation: Enforce strong credentials, lock accounts after failures, and monitor authentication logs for abuse patterns.

[Backdoor]
This section provides a summary of how Backdoor activity manifested in the analyzed traffic. A total of 3689 samples (92.34% of traffic) were classified under this attack type. The summary includes its behavioral signature, severity level, potential impact on IoT infrastructure, and recommended mitigation strategies.
- Count: 3689 (92.34%)
- Category: Persistent Access
- Severity: Critical
- Behavior: Hidden channels or implants enabling an attacker to regain access even after reboots or remediation.
- Risk: Can allow full device control and long-term compromise of the IoT environment.
- Recommendation: Hunt for unrecognized binaries, reverse shells, or custom beaconing behavior. Reflash firmware if needed.

[DDoS_UDP]
This section provides a summary of how DDoS_UDP activity manifested in the analyzed traffic. A total of 10 samples (0.25% of traffic) were classified under this attack type. The summary includes its behavioral signature, severity level, potential impact on IoT infrastructure, and recommended mitigation strategies.
- Count: 10 (0.25%)
- Category: Amplification / Flooding
- Severity: High
- Behavior: High-speed UDP floods, often spoofed, target vulnerable services like NTP, DNS, or SSDP.
- Risk: Can saturate bandwidth, disrupt video streams, or bring down IoT controllers.
- Recommendation: Disable unused UDP services, rate-limit critical ports, and monitor for abnormal packet size bursts.
