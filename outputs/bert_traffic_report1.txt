- No action needed. Traffic appears regular.

[MITM]
This section provides a summary of how MITM activity manifested in the analyzed traffic. A total of 9 samples (0.04% of traffic) were classified under this attack type. The summary includes its behavioral signature, severity level, potential impact on IoT infrastructure, and recommended mitigation strategies.
- Count: 9 (0.04%)
- Category: Interception / Impersonation
- Severity: High
- Behavior: Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks attempt to intercept or alter communications between devices, often through ARP spoofing or rogue gateways.
- Risk: Sensitive data, including credentials or configuration commands, can be silently stolen or manipulated.
- Recommendation: Isolate the affected subnet, inspect ARP tables and DHCP leases, and enforce certificate validation for encrypted traffic.

[Ransomware]
This section provides a summary of how Ransomware activity manifested in the analyzed traffic. A total of 1330 samples (5.34% of traffic) were classified under this attack type. The summary includes its behavioral signature, severity level, potential impact on IoT infrastructure, and recommended mitigation strategies.
- Count: 1330 (5.34%)
- Category: Malware Deployment
- Severity: Critical
- Behavior: Malicious code designed to encrypt device data or lock access until a ransom is paid, possibly spreading laterally across the network.
- Risk: Can disrupt industrial systems or critical home infrastructure, causing major data loss or service outages.
- Recommendation: Immediately isolate affected hosts, restore from clean backups, and assess lateral movement. Report incidents if needed.

[SQL Injection]

The summary includes its behavioral signature, severity level, potential impact on IoT infrastructure, and recommended mitigation strategies.
- Count: 644 (2.58%)
- Category: Injection Exploits
- Severity: High
- Behavior: Malicious SQL statements are injected into application inputs to exfiltrate data or manipulate backend databases.
- Risk: Can compromise user records, leak credentials, or allow remote access to control systems.
- Recommendation: Sanitize all input fields, apply least privilege DB access, and use parameterized queries or ORMs.

[DDoS_HTTP]
This section provides a summary of how DDoS_HTTP activity manifested in the analyzed traffic. A total of 45 samples (0.18% of traffic) were classified under this attack type. The summary includes its behavioral signature, severity level, potential impact on IoT infrastructure, and recommended mitigation strategies.

The summary includes its behavioral signature, severity level, potential impact on IoT infrastructure, and recommended mitigation strategies.
- Count: 2 (0.01%)
- Category: Credential Brute Force
- Severity: Medium
- Behavior: Numerous login attempts with different passwords, targeting SSH, Telnet, HTTP, or MQTT services.
- Risk: Can lead to device hijacking or access to administrative interfaces if default or weak passwords are used.
- Recommendation: Enforce strong credentials, lock accounts after failures, and monitor authentication logs for abuse patterns.

[Vul Scanner]
This section provides a summary of how Vul Scanner activity manifested in the analyzed traffic. A total of 1 samples (0.00% of traffic) were classified under this attack type. The summary includes its behavioral signature, severity level, potential impact on IoT infrastructure, and recommended mitigation strategies.
- Count: 1 (0.00%)
- Category: Exploit Scanning
- Severity: Medium
- Behavior: Automated tools (e.g., Nmap NSE, Nikto, Nessus) scan for known vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.
- Risk: These tools often identify weak firmware, default credentials, or exposed admin panels.
- Recommendation: Patch exposed services, disable unused ports, and fingerprint the scanning tool for possible attribution.

[Backdoor]
This section provides a summary of how Backdoor activity manifested in the analyzed traffic. A total of 22767 samples (91.38% of traffic) were classified under this attack type. The summary includes its behavioral signature, severity level, potential impact on IoT infrastructure, and recommended mitigation strategies.
- Count: 22767 (91.38%)
- Category: Persistent Access
- Severity: Critical
- Behavior: Hidden channels or implants enabling an attacker to regain access even after reboots or remediation.
- Risk: Can allow full device control and long-term compromise of the IoT environment.
- Recommendation: Hunt for unrecognized binaries, reverse shells, or custom beaconing behavior. Reflash firmware if needed.

[DDoS_UDP]
This section provides a summary of how DDoS_UDP activity manifested in the analyzed traffic. A total of 93 samples (0.37% of traffic) were classified under this attack type. The summary includes its behavioral signature, severity level, potential impact on IoT infrastructure, and recommended mitigation strategies.
- Count: 93 (0.37%)
- Category: Amplification / Flooding
- Severity: High
- Behavior: High-speed UDP floods, often spoofed, target vulnerable services like NTP, DNS, or SSDP.
- Risk: Can saturate bandwidth, disrupt video streams, or bring down IoT controllers.
- Recommendation: Disable unused UDP services, rate-limit critical ports, and monitor for abnormal packet size bursts.

=== Interpretation Summary ===
